/* - Create a separate App component
 * - Import and render the App component here
 * - In the App component, render a <main> element
 * - Style everything to look like the slide
 *  - Create a Die component that takes a `value` prop
 * - Render 10 instances of the Die component (manually)
 *      - Provide a number between 1-6 for the value on each
 *        for now
 * - Style the <main> and <Die> components 
 *   to look like they do in the slide
 * Write a function (allNewDice) that returns an array 
 * of 10 random numbers between 1-6 inclusive.
 * Log the array of numbers to the console for now
 * Create state to hold our array of numbers. (Initialize
 * the state by calling our `allNewDice` function so it 
 * loads all new dice as soon as the app loads)
 * 
 * Map over the state numbers array to generate our array
 * of Die elements and render those in place of our
 * manually-written 10 Die elements.
 * Create a `Roll Dice` button that will re-roll
 * all 10 dice
 * 
 * Clicking the button should generate a new array of numbers
 * and set the `dice` state to that new array (thus re-rendering
 * the array to the page)
 * Update the array of numbers in state to be
 * an array of objects instead. Each object should look like:
 * { value: <random number>, isHeld: false }
 * 
 * Making this change will break parts of our code, so make
 * sure to update things so we're back to a working state
 * Add conditional styling to the Die component
 * so that if it's held (isHeld === true), its background color
 * changes to a light green (#59E391)
 * 
 * currently the Die component has no way of knowing
 * if it's "held" or not.
 * Create a function `holdDice` that takes
 * `id` as a parameter. For now, just have the function
 * console.log(id).
 * 
 * Then, figure out how to pass that function down to each
 * instance of the Die component so when each one is clicked,
 * it logs its own unique ID property. (Hint: there's more
 * than one way to make that work, so just choose whichever
 * you want)
 * Update the `holdDice` function to flip
 * the `isHeld` property on the object in the array
 * that was clicked, based on the `id` prop passed
 * into the function.
 * 
 * Hint: as usual, there's > 1 way to accomplish this.
 * I'll be using `dice.map()` and checking for the `id`
 * of the die to determine which one to flip `isHeld` on,
 * but you can do whichever way makes the most sense to you.
 * Update the `rollDice` function to not just roll
 * all new dice, but instead to look through the existing dice
 * to NOT role any that are being `held`.
 * 
 * Hint: this will look relatively similiar to the `holdDice`
 * function below. When creating new dice, remember to use
 * `id: nanoid()` so any new dice have an `id` as well.
 * 1. Add new state called `tenzies`, default to false. It
 *    represents whether the user has won the game yet or not.
 * 2. Add an effect that runs every time the `dice` state array 
 *    changes. For now, just console.log("Dice state changed").
 * Check the dice array for these winning conditions:
 * 1. All dice are held, and
 * 2. all dice have the same value
 * 
 * If both conditions are true, set `tenzies` to true and log
 * "You won!" to the console
 * Tie off loose ends!
 * 1. If tenzies is true, Change the button text to "New Game"
 * 2. If tenzies is true, use the "react-confetti" package to
 *    render the <Confetti /> component ðŸŽ‰
 * 
 *    Hint: don't worry about the `height` and `width` props
 *    it mentions in the documentation.
 * Allow the user to play a new game when the button is clicked and they've already won
